Unity Engine game still being developed.


Using last version of unity, always.
Still missing Game Design Document.

The main ideia is to develop a RPG focused on battle mechanics which will 
follow most MOBA's mechanics but will be usgin the xbox 360 controller
as the main input.

Development currently paused while i search for an artist whiling to help. :)
